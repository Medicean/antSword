Get AntSword
---

> Requirement: AntSword >=v2.0.0

##### 1.Download AntSword Loader.

Starting from v2.0.0-beta, we introduce the concepts of `Loader`. Users or developers only need to download the AntSword Loader according to your OS. Everyone can directly edit/execute/debug the latest source code for developers and for users without extra environment.

Please select specific loader according to your loader:

##### 2.Get source code & Load Source

When you firstly open loader, the interface looks like this:

![firt time to open loader][img_get_antsword_1]

Click 「`Initialize`」, select an empty directory as AntSword Work Directory. After that, reopen the AntSword loader. Then you should be able to see the main interface of AntSword.

![Main Interface][img_get_antsword_2]

Of course, if you already have the AntSword source code before, you can select this directory as the working directory when you select the working directory in this step.

> Are you still in the installation? I'm sorry to tell you: Everything is done. :>
